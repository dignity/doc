The collection of thoughts and ideas assembled in this writing are the culmination of countless discussions with close friends, family members, strangers and fellow travellers. Their thoughts, feelings and values are deeply interwoven in this writing, and have fundamentally helped shape the core of my person. As a friend and fellow couchsurfer once taught me, \textit{what we think, we become}.
